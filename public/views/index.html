I love learning about new technologies and just playing around. It's exciting taking on new challenges, pushing yourself to grow and step out of your comfort zone. Outside of coding, I love to dance and am well versed in different styles. Dancing is something that I love to do outside in my free time and I always push myself to grow as a dancer and as a coder. I also really enjoy watching anime and reading manga in my spare time as well.

              This past summer, I furthered my Computer Science endeavors by interning at a company called Everyone Counts, which manages voting services for customers. Currently, Everyone Counts is contracted by the state of New Jersey to rebuild their Statewide Voter Registration Site. At Everyone Counts, I developed a brand new Behavior Driven Development Framework using Cucumber and Protractor to test the front end functionality of the website. I eventually handed this project off to the actual QA team who officially uses the Framework that I built for their automated regression tests. I also assisted in the development of their website on both the front end and back end side. I remodeled webpages with a modernized UI using Angular and NodeJS, ensuring that data was able to be grabbed from the APIâ€™s efficiently and optimally.

There I taught fundamental programming concepts to children using the program Scratch. We challenged the students by giving them increasingly challenging programming assignments as they went along. Our programming assignments were in the form of games, so that would provide a pleasant experience for the children while they trained their minds to think in a programming specific way. The curriculum is self paced, so students were free to join whenever and go learn at their own speed so that no student would "fall behind" and we would be able to provide adequate assistance for them.

There I helped prepare course material, planned the class schedule and lectured to the class. I was an assistant for the Primary Geography class, which was mainly full of students from grades 1 and 2. I would lecture simultaneously with the teacher and teach the students interesting facts about specific states in the country, and then swap students with the teacher.

Founded by the Korean American Student Association, it was a team designed for Freshman during their first quarter of college to join a team and compete against other KASA organizations over Southern California. There I met so many of my closest friends today and got the joy of learning hip hop choreography.</font>

I thought to myself how cool it looked and how insane it would be if I could breakdance as well. So I pushed myself and I trained hard. I practiced to the point where I would have 6 bruises simultaneously, but that never stopped me. I perservered and trained further. The feeling of excitement after successfully executing a move pushed me. When I entered college, I immediately searched for UCSD's Breakdancing Club and found Bodyrock.</font>
